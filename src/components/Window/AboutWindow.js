                          Hello, I'm Mikko, and my journey into the tech world
                          started as a digital native growing up alongside the
                          evolution of the internet. Born in the '90s, I grew up in the days of screeching AOL dial-up, and on the
                          early internet gems like Newgrounds and
                          Ebaumsworld. My online adventures often led me to
                          platforms like addictinggames.com, Neopets, and the
                          world of customizing websites on Piczo, Freewebs, and
                          MySpace. Back then, my friends and I created personalized websites with themed layouts, music
                          players, custom cursors, and playful right-click
                          alerts, a testament to our budding creativity in the
                          digital realm.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          As life progressed, so did my interests and
                          responsibilities, guiding me on a path to prepare for
                          the real world. The internet underwent a rapid
                          transformation during this time, and I found myself
                          returning to it, not just as a leisurely pastime, but
                          as a potential career.

                          <br />
                          Fast forward to today - I've transitioned from those
                          nostalgic online adventures to becoming a Full Stack
                          Web Developer through rigorous training at Lighthouse
                          Labs, one of Canada's leading private career colleges
                          for web development and data science. Armed with
                          modern, robust tools for building full-stack web
                          applications, my childhood past-time with online
                          customization has transformed into a
                          pursuit of merging design with technical
                          implementation.

                          <br />
                          During my intensive bootcamp experience, I learned to
                          thrive in an environment of rapid learning and
                          constant change. Collaborating with peers in
                          high-pressure situations honed my time management
                          skills, enabling effective prioritization and
                          organization.

                          <br />
                          My foundation in web development is fueled by my
                          curiosity and commitment to staying
                          current with industry trends and technological
                          advancements. I'm always eager to explore innovative
                          ways of pushing the boundaries of creativity within
                          the realms of design and technical implementation.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Now, as I transition from my hospitality industry
                          background into the tech sector, I'm excited about the
                          opportunities that lie ahead. My journey, which began
                          as a curious internet enthusiast, has evolved into a
                          passionate pursuit of excellence in development. I
                          invite you to explore my resume and GitHub
                          page to witness the outcomes of this exciting journey.

                          like Newgrounds and Ebaumsworld. I kept myself
                          entertained for hours on addictinggames.com, Neopets,
                          and built static blogging sites with code templates on
                          Piczo, Freewebs and MySpace. My friends and I would
