                        Hello, I'm Mikko, and my journey into the tech world
                        started as a digital native growing up alongside the
                        evolution of the internet. Born in the '90s, I grew up
                        in the days of screeching AOL dial-up, and on the early
                        internet gems like Newgrounds and Ebaumsworld. My online
                        adventures often led me to platforms like
                        addictinggames.com, Neopets, and the world of
                        customizing websites on Piczo, Freewebs, and MySpace.
                        Back then, my friends and I created personalized
                        websites with themed layouts, music players, custom
                        cursors, and playful right-click alerts, a testament to
                        our budding creativity in the digital realm.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As life progressed, so did my interests and
                        responsibilities, guiding me on a path to prepare for
                        the real world. The internet underwent a rapid
                        transformation during this time, and I found myself
                        returning to it, not just as a leisurely pastime, but as
                        a potential career.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Fast forward to today - I've transitioned from those
                        nostalgic online adventures to becoming a Full Stack Web
                        Developer through rigorous training at Lighthouse Labs,
                        one of Canada's leading private career colleges for web
                        development and data science. Armed with modern, robust
                        tools for building full-stack web applications, my
                        childhood past-time with online customization has
                        transformed into a pursuit of merging design with
                        technical implementation.

                        <br />
                        During my intensive bootcamp experience, I learned to
                        thrive in an environment of rapid learning and constant
                        change. Collaborating with peers in high-pressure
                        situations honed my time management skills, enabling
                        effective prioritization and organization.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My foundation in web development is fueled by my
                        curiosity and commitment to staying current with
                        industry trends and technological advancements. I'm
                        always eager to explore innovative ways of pushing the
                        boundaries of creativity within the realms of design and
                        technical implementation.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now, as I transition from my hospitality industry
                        background into the tech sector, I'm excited about the
                        opportunities that lie ahead. My journey, which began as
                        a curious internet enthusiast, has evolved into a
                        passionate pursuit of excellence in development. I
                        invite you to explore my resume and GitHub page to
                        witness the outcomes of this exciting journey.

                          like Newgrounds and Ebaumsworld. I kept myself
                          entertained for hours on addictinggames.com, Neopets,
                          and built static blogging sites with code templates on
                          Piczo, Freewebs and MySpace. My friends and I would

                          would say something like "nice try xoxo" we couldn't
